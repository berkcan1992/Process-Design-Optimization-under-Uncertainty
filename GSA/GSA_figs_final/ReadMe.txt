MultBonds_All: GSA for multiple bond lengths between several filaments.
			These filaments are 1&2, 20&21, 50&51, 87&88 -> means 
			these are 1st, 20th, 50th and 87th interface/bonds.
			_All means: all parameters (heat transfer model: alpha (density*specificHeat)...
			, hconv, lam1, lam2, lam3, lam4)
						(neck growth model parameters: b1, b2, eta, gamma).

Multiple bonds: GSA for multiple bond lengths between several filaments.
			These filaments are 1&2, 20&21, 50&51, 87&88 -> means 
			these are 1st, 20th, 50th and 87th interface/bonds.
			Parameters: (heat transfer model: alpha (density*specificHeat),...
				neck growth model parameters: b1, b2, eta, gamma).

SeparateSurfCont_roC: The analysis is done for 6 filaments usually.
			These filaments are 2,3,4,87,88,89.
			Parameters are (heat transfer model: roC (density*specificHeat)...
			, hconv, lam1, lam2, lam3, lam4)
